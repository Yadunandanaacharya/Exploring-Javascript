Stuff or configuration both are same.

After opening index.pug
go to View-> apperance->enable Status bar-> press on pug -> Some dropdown will
apper -> press on HTML. So that you can use "Shift + !" to get html body easily.

Sending variable through HTMl:
Like sending title in params which is an object

We need to send params

Title displayed as Pubg is the best game

You need to write content with Inverted colon: "content"

Important inside .pug file you need to use content inside flower bracket:
#{content}

Go to pug documentation there they have mentioned how to use pug with plain 
text. If you want to use multiple texts then use "pipes"

Pipe character will be "|" this symbol which is present upon enter keyword in
the keyboard.

Linking css file in pug. That is style.css
Just check pug or if you are using ejs check ejs documenttaion how
to use css files inside. 

https://pugjs.org/language/includes.html

With code: style
        include style.css
you'll get error.

 style
        include/static/style.css
        With this also you'll get error.

Now also you'll get error: Error: the "basedir" option 
is required to use includes and extends with "absolute" paths

So you need to go outside to get connected with app.Js with code "../"

When we use include, program will check style.css file inside the Views folder.
So we came out of one directory outside.

Making links:  <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/">ABout</a></li>
            <li><a href="/">Contact us</a></li>

To see changes in browser execute always app.js file also, or else if you are using 
nodemon then saving again and again is also good.
