After creting file if you use postman:
localhost:3000/ type this in postman

It will give you response with GEt request

Nodemon I have installed with 
npm install -g nodemon
for globally 
rs - restart

watching extensions: js,mjs,json for restarting

I have used both get and post request. 
You can change it in postman.
With nodemon you can just save 
automatically server will restart.


Status code sending: app.get('/about',(req,res)=>{
    res.status(200).send('Hi I am sending status code 200')
})

you will see this in postman
