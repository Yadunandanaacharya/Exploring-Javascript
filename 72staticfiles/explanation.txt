Static files are those files which we want to kepp publicly on the server
so that anybody can access it.  Without login anybosy can access that file.

app.use('/static',express.static('static'))

Here you need to create folder named with static.
If you type "code ." in terminal then your current directory only
will open in new window in vsCode.

Create folder named static

When you do http://localhost:3000/static/index.js in web page
Display will be: console.log('Using static files')
Which are contenst of index.js

In express we can use template engines: takes an tokenized strings and produce a
rendered strings. You can search in google about this.

Using pug template engine

Always install libraries in main directory like example 
opening a new terminal: Exploring-Javascript-> "here install"

Don't install inside 70Express.

Using pug: app.set('view engine','pug')

Using path module: 
const path = require('path')

IMPORTANT: 
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname,'views'))
wE have used above code with path module, so this checks for "views" folder
in your current directory.

Create views folder

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Hey', message: 'Hello there!' })
})
This one copied from http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html

When you use : http://localhost:3000/pugdemo in browser
It will display message you have written.
Inside render you need to use same filename.

If you see "view page source or Ctrl+U" then you can see it isproperly rendered
with html file.
