               <p>If you open HTML file from different folder, then you have to select that folder
                   in VScode after that if you press on live server it will open properly, or else it will 
                   show something different. Example your another file in file folder name "html css javascript"
                   opened but now you'll directly open another html file from "exploring javascript" folder withouy
                   doing open folder at the beginning then whatever you type inside paragraph in that file, when you press
                   on open with live seever it won't display whatever you have typed.
